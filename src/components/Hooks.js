            1. Initial render /Mounting: In Class based components we have
            componentDidMount, which runs after the initial render. To replace
            this in Hooks we have: useEffect without any dependencies ([])
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            2. Updating: In updating phase as a replacement for
            componentDidUpdate, we have the same hook, useEffect but this the we
            wonâ€™t be passing any 2nd arguments to it. <br /> But problem with
            this code is that it will run every time, even on the initial
            render, if you want your code to run only when a specific dependency
            has changed then you need to pass it as its 2nd argument.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            3. Unmounting: In unmounting we have only one lifecycle method
            componentWillUnmount and we can achieve that in Hooks by returning a
            function from useEffect, it will act as an effect cleanup.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
